It's the default interception mechanism of NSA for both voice, PS2 and USB keyboard keypresses, exfiltered data, network traffic and any kind of data the NSA is interested to extract from a target. It's a very advanced attack where a Radar sends a [[CW]] toward a target covertly equipped with a eavesdropping bug called a [[RETROREFLECTOR]] which will modulate the original [[CW]] signal and re-radiate this modulated [[CW]] so that it can be picked up by the emitting Radar. The benefit of such technique is that there is no need for the eavesdropping bug to generate radio signal, and therefore, no need for huge batteries or power. It also means that the bug can be turned on and off remotely, providing easy way to turn off the bug when a bug sweep detection team is trying to located it. The downside is that it's dangerous for health as the Radar signal between 1Ghz and 6Ghz can be harmful to human and cause illness and cancer, as it did numerous times in the past since the first time it was detected in the US Embassy in Moscow, Russia.","_id":"6sPHyNSSJSqFrowrH"},{"agency":"[[NSA]]","alias":[],"category":"program","compartments":[],"family":"collect","links":[["http://cryptome.org/2014/01/nsa-codenames.htm","cryptome.org - NSA codenames"],["http://nsa.gov1.info/dni/nsa-ant-catalog","nsa.gov1.info/dni/nsa-ant-catalog"]],"name":"CYCLONE","relatedItemsParents":[],"relatedItemsChildren":[],"relatedItems":["[[TYPHON]]","[[CANDYGRAM]]","[[DRTBOX]]","[[NEBULA]]"],"status":"unknown","tags":["[[gsm]]","[[phone]]"],"description":"EGSM base station router, used for collection GSM cell phone signals.

PRISM is a government code name for a data-collection effort. The PRISM program collects stored Internet communications based on demands made to Internet companies such as Google Inc. or Apple Inc. under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments  Act of 2008 to turn over any data that match court-approved search  terms. The NSA can use these PRISM requests to target communications that were encrypted when they traveled across the Internet backbone, to  focus on stored data that telecommunication filtering systems discarded earlier, and to get data that is easier to handle, among other things. The program is operated under the supervision of the U.S. Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA Court, or FISC) pursuant to the  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Documents indicate that  PRISM is \"the number one source of raw intelligence used for NSA  analytic reports\", and it accounts for 91% of the NSA's Internet traffic  acquired under FISA section 702 authority. The leaked information came  to light one day after the revelation that the FISA Court had been  ordering a subsidiary of telecommunications company Verizon  Communications to turn over to the NSA logs tracking all of its  customers' telephone calls on an ongoing daily basis.","_id":"NwwYvLjf2SkBG75Aw"},{"agency":"[[NSA]]","alias":[],"category":"compartment","compartments":[],"family":"collect","links":[["http://www.intrepidreport.com/archives/8588","intrepidreport.com - Senate delivers fatal end-of-term blow to Constitution"]],"name":"PROTEIN","relatedItemsParents":[],"relatedItemsChildren":[],"relatedItems":[],"status":"unknown","tags":[],"description":"SIGINT Exchange Designators with Third or Fourth Parties.","_id":"3gYGcLtCrKQDgvu9H"},{"agency":"[[NSA]]","alias":[],"category":"program","compartments":[],"family":"database","links":[["http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/08/an-educated-guess-about-how-the-nsa-is-structured/278697/","theatlantic.com - An Educated Guess About How the NSA Is Structured"],["http://hbpub.vo.llnwd.net/o16/video/olmk/holt/greenwald/NoPlaceToHide-Documents-Uncompressed.pdf","Documents from the Glenn Greenwald's book \"No Place to Hide\""]],"name":"PROTON","relatedItemsParents":[],"relatedItemsChildren":[],"relatedItems":[],"status":"unknown","tags":["[[metadata]]"],"description":"SIGINT database for time-sensitive targets/counterintelligence.Fields in the database : Called & calling numbers, date, time & duration of call.  149 billion of call Events, for date range 2000-2006.","_id":"ftqzaw9wTxaTR4wkA"},{"agency":"[[NSA]]","alias":[],"category":"compartment","compartments":[],"family":"collect","links":[["http://www.intrepidreport.com/archives/8588","intrepidreport.com - Senate delivers fatal end-of-term blow to Constitution"]],"name":"PYLON","relatedItemsParents":[],"relatedItemsChildren":[],"relatedItems":[],"status":"unknown","tags":[],"description":"SIGINT Exchange Designators with Third or Fourth Parties.","_id":"Fq8G2HLsa4mvxYy4S"},{"agency":"[[NSA]]","alias":[],"category":"attack vector","compartments":[],"family":"network","links":[["http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2013/30C3_-_5713_-_en_-_saal_2_-_201312301130_-_to_protect_and_infect_part_2_-_jacob.html","media.ccc.de - To Protect And Infect Part 2"],["http://www.dailytech.com/Tax+and+Spy+How+the+NSA+Can+Hack+Any+American+Stores+Data+15+Years/article34010.htm"," dailytech.com - Tax and Spy: How the NSA Can Hack Any American, Stores Data 15 Years"],["http://www.wikileaks-forum.com/nsa/332/snowden-leak-nsa-qfire-16-slides/26507/","wikileaks-forum.com - Forward-based Defense with QFIRE June 3 , 2011"],["https://www.eff.org/document/20131230-spiegel-qfire","Slides about QUANTUM, QFIRE and TURBULENCE"],["http://cryptome.org/2014/01/nsa-codenames.htm","cryptome.org - NSA codenames"]],"name":"QFIRE","relatedItemsParents":["[[TURMOIL]]","[[TURBINE]]"],"relatedItemsChildren":[],"relatedItems":["[[QUANTUM]]","[[FOXACID]]","[[TURMOIL]]","[[QUANTUMTHEORY]]"],"status":"unknown","tags":["[[router]]","[[router]]"],"description":"System used for infecting computers.
